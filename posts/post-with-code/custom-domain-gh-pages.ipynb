If your custom domain is `www.myblog.com`, you need to create a `CNAME` record that points your custom domain to `<github-user>.github.io` (Note that you have to exclude the repository name that contains your blog). You will have to ask for your domain provider about how to create this file. Once the `CNAME` file is created\n",
